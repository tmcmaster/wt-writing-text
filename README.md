Web Component to simulate text being written

This is just a POC at this point, and would still need some refinement
if it was to be used in a project.

The web component at the moment will break the text into as many lines 
as it needs to fill the height of the component. 

Therefore you can use CSS to style the component size, to decide how many lines you want the text in.

You can also configure the height of each line of text.

This is a quick POC, so sometime you need to fiddle with the numbers to get the layout and flow of text writing to look good. For example, if you make the box wide than it needs to be, there will be a delay while the coloured bar underneath takes time to move under the part of the panel with no text on it.

It is just a POC, so I did not want to spend too much time on it.
